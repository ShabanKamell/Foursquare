# Foursquare

Foursquare app represents a real world app example. it provides a fairly complex set of functionalities. 
It's a suitable showcase for all the advantages that SwiftUI, Combine, and modular architecture bring.
It has all features that would make it a modular, scalable, testable and maintainable app.

## App Logic

- The app displays the list of nearby venues from **Foursquare** Places API.
- If there's no network connection, the data will be fetched from `CoreData` which saved in the last time.

## Stack:
- [ ] SwiftUI
- [ ] Combine
- [ ] Async/Await
- [ ] MVVM
- [ ] Modular architecture

## Modular Architecture

## README

Each module has its own `README.md` file that documents the module.

## Important Notes

- [ ] To compile the app and get it working, you have to add the following struct in `Data/Data`
and don't forget to add your **Foursquare token**.

```swift
struct FoursquareToken {
    static let token = "TOKEN_HERE"
}
```

- [ ] In Data/DataTests, there's a very simple example demonstrates how we can test repos.
